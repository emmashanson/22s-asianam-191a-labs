            <h2> Mini-Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Emma Hanson and I am a second year Chemical engineering major with an Asian Lanuages and Cultures Minor. As for future career goals, I am interested in working in the chemical engineering industry but the minor as well as classes such as these and student organizations that I am involved in really make me want to be able to participate in volunteering/non-profit organizations in my free time even post grad.
             I also do have goals to be able to work internationally, even for a brief period of time, and learn about the world outside of just Southern California.   
            One of my big goals in this class to learn technical skills while learning to apply them in causes outside the traditional tech roles I often am exposed to.  I am really looking forward to the interdisciplinary nature of this class! </p>
            
            
            <h3>Some things I am involved in include: </h3>
